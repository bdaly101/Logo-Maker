# Logo-Maker

## Description

The Simple Logo Generator is a command-line application designed to empower freelance web developers with the ability to quickly create simple, customizable logos for their projects without the need for a graphic designer. Utilizing Node.js for the backend logic, this app leverages Inquirer.js to handle user inputs through the command line, allowing for the selection of text, colors, and shapes. SVG.js is employed to dynamically generate scalable vector graphics (SVG) files based on the user's specifications, resulting in a downloadable `logo.svg` file. This tool embodies a practical application of these technologies, streamlining the logo design process for developers.
